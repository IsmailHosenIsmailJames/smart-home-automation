# Smart/Dynamic Home Automation

ðŸš€ **Project Update:** Smart Home Automation System with Dynamic Pin Control and Real-Time Feedback ðŸš€

One of the key challenges I faced in my previous Smart Home Automation Project was the lack of flexibility across different ESP microcontroller boards. Each board's pin configuration differs, which requires code modifications for each unique model. Additionally, my previous setup lacked feedback capabilities to confirm whether signals were received by the ESP or if tasks were successfully completed.

To address these issues, I redesigned the system to allow dynamic configuration using Flutter and Firebase. Here's what I accomplished:

ðŸ”¹ **Dynamic Pin Assignment:** I built an Android app with Flutter App, connected to Firebase Realtime Database, where pins can be defined and updated directly from the app. This flexibility enables real-time pin configuration, removing the need for board-specific code adjustments.

ðŸ”¹ **Real-Time Feedback:** The ESP microcontroller now continuously reads pin configurations and reacts in real time. If a pinâ€™s state changes, it immediately sends feedback to Firebase, which then updates the app. This ensures users receive instant confirmation that the command was executed successfully.

ðŸ’¡ **Result:** With this new setup, my code is now independent of any specific ESP board, as pin assignments are handled entirely through the app. This dynamic approach enhances both reliability and user experience in smart home automation.

I'm excited about the improvements this brings to smart home technology and look forward to applying this method to future projects!
